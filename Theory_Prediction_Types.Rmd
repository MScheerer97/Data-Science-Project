<!-- In the prediction task, we distinguish between the full and food model: -->

<!-- * **Full Model**: One model for all food-type-size-country combinations. In this model, we assume -->
<!-- that the features' impact is the same for all food types. Hence, this model is only trained for -->
<!-- the more complex algorithms which can identify interaction effects on their own. Precisely, -->
<!-- the full model exists for the random forests, XGBoost, SVM and Neural Network.  -->

In this tab, the user can make price predictions for the upcoming weeks one to four.
To do so, the user can select between a variety of models and five wholesale markets
in Germany. In addition, the user needs to specify the type of food for which he or she
wants to make the predictions.

The models' predictions are based on the so called *food model* in order to
avoid homogeneous effects. More precisely, 
one separate model for each food item is trained. For the BSTS model, we train
one separate model for each food-type-size-country information. 


<!-- Nevertheless, both models perform similarly as the differences in predictive accuracy are minor. -->

* File Documentation *
**********************

* A detailed explanation of each file can be found in the Excel document "File Management"
* This file only concerns the order of the files.

* Files starting with 01, 05, and 09 need not to be executed any more
	** Files starting with 01 are our data foundation and the results are already stored in the output folder.
	** Files starting with 05 train our machine learning models; since data for 5 years (2016 until 17th January 2022) is included; it is
	   unlikely that the models need to be trained again in the near future
	** Files 09 include the hyperparameter analysis which is based on the results from file 05.

* To update the data the remaining files need to be executed in the following order
	** 02 Files
	** 03 File
	** 04 File
	** 06 File
	** 07 File
	** 08 File
	** 09 File


* Alternatively, you can automate the data update by running file 10_Update_Data

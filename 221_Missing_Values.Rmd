#### **Missing Values Imputation**

* Sometimes the price variables contain missing values. In this case, the missing
values are replaced using chained random forests (`missRanger` function and package).
In chained random forests random forest imputation is combined with predictive mean matching. 
This ensures that the imputations are natural and their distribution realistic. 

* For all other missing values, for instance exchange rate, the missing value
is replaced by the previous value.

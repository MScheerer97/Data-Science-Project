In our analysis, we have train two types of models: full and food model.

* **Full Model**: The full model is a single model trained on the full data set.
The individual food items are identified via dummy variables. 

* **Food Model**: The food model is a single model for each food item, i.e.,
we train one model for apples, one for bananas etc. 

In the upcoming analysis, the price predictions are made using the food models as
they are superior in terms of predictive accuracy to the full models.
However, the user can explore the hyperparameters and performance measures for
both the full and food model.

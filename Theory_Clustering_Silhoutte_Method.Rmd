The average silhouette method is based on the total within-cluster variation. Precisely, it determines how well each observations lies within its cluster. To do so, the average silhouette of observations for different values of $K$ is computed.
The silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1. Generally, a good clustering solution is indicated by a high average silhouette. Hence, in the analysis, the number of clusters $K$ is chosen according to the highest average silhouette.

An exemplary plot for determining the optimal number of clusters $K$ is shown in the following figure: \

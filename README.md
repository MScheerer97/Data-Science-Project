### About The Project

Have you ever purchased some produce and then the next week the price plummeted? As the Covid-19 pandemic has emphasized, in our contemporary world globalization and the resulting interconnectedness come with severe consequences for our markets.<br>

Travel restrictions have had significant influence on prices of various goods. Another infamous example is the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction caused by the grounding of Ever Given, a container ship [2021 Suez Canal Obstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Suez_Canal_obstruction).<br>

</p>

Hence, our central aim is to gather data from various sources, prepare a clean dataset and finally build **Machine Learning Models** to accurately **predict prices** for different kinds of fruit and vegetable. We implement profound and insightful data visualization techniques to ensure interpretability of our key findings.<br>

We compare different models for prediction and finally decide which model is most appropriate for real world usage. Our goal is to illustrate our results by hosting a __R Shiny App__ and making it publicly available.
